# Antigravity Server

A second front door to your own Antigravity — one that fixes the mobile web UI,  
keeps the UI off Google's relay, and runs unattended on a cheap Linux box.

## Why Antigravity Server? (vs Official Remote)

Google now ships an official remote bridge at `antigravity.google.com`: sign in with the same account and you reach every machine of yours that is running Antigravity with remote access enabled. **Reaching your own agent from a phone is no longer something this project has to provide** — and a headless Linux server shows up in that list too.

What the official bridge hands your phone is the desktop web bundle, unchanged. That is where `agy-server` earns its place: it sits in front of the same Antigravity core as a second, direct front door, and rewrites that bundle on the way out so a touch screen can actually use it.

The two are not exclusive. `agy-server` only enables the same `remoteControlEnabled` setting the official bridge uses, so one machine can serve both at once — use whichever address suits you.

| | Official remote (`antigravity.google.com`) | Antigravity Server (`agy-server`) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mobile web UI** | The desktop bundle as-is | **25 named runtime patches** for touch |
| **Conversation control** | No delete, pin, or archive on mobile | **Delete, Rename, Pin, Archive** from the kebab menu and titlebar |
| **Project navigation** | No project `(+)` button; switch via the bottom input | **Restored `(+)` button** in project list headers |
| **Message actions** | Undo and Copy live behind hover states | **Undo (`↶`) and Copy (`📋`)** always visible on touch |
| **iOS keyboard** | Bottom safe-area gap remains open; viewport jumps on focus; Enter corrupts IME composition | Pinned top bar, collapsed safe area, adapted height, stabilized question modal interaction, and CJK/Korean IME composition protection on Enter (native viewport panning & dual scrolling) |
| **File uploads** | 1MB RPC text limit | **Chunked streaming uploader** for large logs, HARs, and datasets |
| **Connection path** | Relayed through Google's servers | **Direct** — your own domain, LAN, or VPN |
| **Server restarts** | Language server restart invalidates session; manual page refresh required | **Seamless auto-reconnect** — persistent CSRF token & gRPC status 14 translation restore connection without refreshing |
| **Access without a Google account** | Not possible — the account is the gate | Your own password (PBKDF2), sessions, and rate limiting |

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Linux Server / Cloud VPS (Recommended)

Run Antigravity on a headless Linux instance (Oracle Cloud Free Tier, AWS, DigitalOcean, or a home server):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AFSlayer/antigravity-server/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

The installer:
1. Prompts for your domain (e.g. `agy.example.com`) and workspace root.
2. Downloads `language_server` directly from Google's official build bucket (`storage.googleapis.com`). No Google binaries are redistributed.
3. Configures Caddy for automatic HTTPS, creates a systemd service, and sets access credentials.

#### Google Authentication
When accessing your server for the first time:
- **Direct Web Login**: Open the Web UI, navigate to **Settings**, and complete Google authentication directly in your browser.
- **Or Copy Existing Token (Optional)**: If you already logged in on a local desktop, you can copy your token to skip re-authenticating:
  ```bash
  scp ~/.gemini/jetski-standalone-oauth-token user@your-server:~/.gemini/
  ```

---

### Option 2: Desktop Companion (macOS, Windows, Linux Desktop)

To expose a local desktop Antigravity instance over your local network:

```bash
# macOS & Linux
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AFSlayer/antigravity-server/main/scripts/install-desktop.sh | bash
```

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AFSlayer/antigravity-server/main/scripts/install-desktop.ps1 | iex
```

`agy-server` opens a local control panel with a QR code. Scan the code from a phone on the same network to connect without typing a password.

## Mobile PWA & Client Setup

Antigravity Server supports the Progressive Web App (PWA) standard. Adding it to your mobile home screen launches the interface in a **fullscreen, standalone view with no browser address bar or navigation buttons**:

- **iOS (Safari)**: Tap the **Share button (`⎋`)** → Select **Add to Home Screen**.
- **Android (Chrome)**: Tap the **Menu (`⋮`)** → Select **Install app** or **Add to Home screen**.

> [!TIP]
> Running in standalone PWA mode ensures virtual keyboard transitions and 0px safe-area collapse operate smoothly without browser toolbar jumps.

---

## Key Features

### ⚡ Mobile-First UX Patches
- **Touch-Friendly Controls**: Undo (`↶`) and Copy (`📋`) buttons remain permanently visible on mobile message bubbles.
- **Full Conversation Management**: Delete conversations via the titlebar menu and toggle Pin/Archive directly from the history dropdown.
- **Precise Keyboard Tracking**: Automatically collapses safe area insets to 0px and pins top navigation bar while adapting conversation height.

### 📁 Chunked Streaming File Uploads
Standard Antigravity restricts file attachments via a 1MB RPC limit. `agy-server` injects a chunked streaming uploader to transfer large logs, datasets, or HAR files directly into your workspace:

### 🖥️ Desktop & Tablet Web Interface
In addition to mobile devices, Antigravity Server runs smoothly in any modern desktop browser:

</div>

---

### 🔄 Zero-Downtime Automatic Updates
On headless Linux servers, `agy-server` includes a background auto-updater service:
- Checks Google's official release buckets daily for new `language_server` versions.
- Downloads and replaces the core binary atomically with zero downtime.
- Manual check & upgrade: run `agy-server update`.

---

### 🔁 Seamless Auto-Reconnection & Session Persistence
When the language server restarts (such as during updates or service reloads) or the connection briefly drops:
- **Persistent CSRF Token**: Retains the same authentication token across restarts, preventing stale-session rejections.
- **gRPC-Web Protocol Translation**: Translates transient connection drops to standard `grpc-status: 14` (Unavailable) rather than broken HTTP 502 HTML, enabling Antigravity's native state stream to automatically reconnect within seconds without refreshing the browser tab.

---

### 📝 In-App Rules & Skills Editor
Manage your agent instructions (`~/.gemini/GEMINI.md`, `~/.gemini/config/skills/`) and project rules directly within the web UI:
- Open **Settings → Customizations**.
- Click the native **Edit** button next to rules or skills to expand an inline code editor.
- Updates are saved atomically to the host filesystem with instant effect.

---

## Production & Reverse Proxy Setup

Antigravity uses Server-Sent Events (SSE), WebSocket connections, and chunked streaming. If running behind a custom reverse proxy, disable proxy buffering and configure WebSocket upgrades:

`agy-server` gzips responses itself, including the streamed conversation snapshot and the patched bundle, so compression at the reverse proxy is optional. Direct access over Tailscale or LAN gets the same compression with no proxy in front.

### Tailscale, LAN and localhost: turn on HTTPS for HTTP/2

Browsers open at most six connections to a plain-HTTP host, and the Antigravity UI holds six long-lived streams per open conversation. Over plain HTTP every other request then waits in the browser until a stream drops, which shows up as threads that take 20 seconds or more to open even though the server answered in milliseconds. HTTP/2 multiplexes everything over one connection, and browsers only negotiate it over TLS.

`agy-server` can terminate TLS itself with a certificate issued by your Tailscale node:

```bash
agy-server --tls tailscale            # or: agy-server config --tls tailscale
```

This needs **MagicDNS** and **HTTPS Certificates** enabled under DNS in the Tailscale admin console. The certificate is valid for your node's MagicDNS name, so open `https://<machine>.<tailnet>.ts.net:8765`, not the `100.x` address. The certificate is cached in the data directory and renewed automatically.

With your own certificate, for a LAN name or `localhost`:

```bash
agy-server --tls file --tls-cert cert.pem --tls-key key.pem
```

If you would rather keep `agy-server` on plain HTTP, `tailscale serve --bg 8765` in front of it gives the same HTTPS and HTTP/2 on the Tailscale address only.

### Access log

To see what a slow page is doing, write one line per request with its status, duration, bytes, and how many requests were in flight when it started:

```bash
agy-server --access-log ~/agy-access.log
tail -f ~/agy-access.log
```

Requests still open after five seconds are logged once as `OPEN`; on plain HTTP, six of those is the browser's connection budget gone. `AGY_DEBUG=1` writes the log to `access.log` in the data directory without further flags.

### Caddy
```caddyfile
agy.example.com {
    encode zstd gzip

    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8765 {
        flush_interval -1
    }
}
```

### Nginx
```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name agy.example.com;

    # Allow large chunked streaming uploads
    client_max_body_size 0;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8765;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;

        # WebSocket support
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";

        # Disable buffering for real-time agent token streaming
        proxy_buffering off;
        proxy_cache off;
        proxy_read_timeout 86400s;

        # Forward real client IP
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When running behind a reverse proxy, pass `--trusted-proxies 127.0.0.1/32` (or set `AGY_TRUSTED_PROXIES=127.0.0.1/32`) so brute-force rate limiters inspect the genuine client IP rather than the proxy.

---

## How It Works

Antigravity includes a standalone binary named `language_server`. When run with `--standalone`, it serves the Antigravity Web UI on `127.0.0.1`.

`agy-server` acts as a reverse proxy to:
- Handle authentication (PBKDF2 hashing, cookie sessions, rate-limiting).
- Apply on-the-fly JS/CSS patches for touch devices.
- Provide a chunked streaming endpoint for large file uploads.

## Mobile UX Patches

The web bundle Antigravity serves — through the official remote bridge or through `agy-server` — is the desktop one. `agy-server` rewrites it in flight. The registry in [`internal/patches/registry.go`](internal/patches/registry.go) holds 45 patches, 25 of them touch-specific and the rest covering uploads, navigation, sign-in and cache busting. A sample:

| Category | Desktop Bundle Behavior | agy-server Patch |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Navigation** | Project `(+)` button omitted on mobile screens | Restores the `(+)` New Conversation button next to each project row |
| **Conversation Actions** | No delete, pin, or archive on touch | Adds Delete, Pin, and Archive to the `⋮` kebab menu and titlebar |
| **Message Actions** | Undo and Copy buttons hidden behind hover states | Displays Undo (`↶`) and Copy (`📋`) buttons on touch devices |
| **Virtual Keyboard & Scroll** | iOS Safari viewport bounces and leaves blank gaps on scroll | Dynamic visualViewport offset tracking, 0px safe-area collapse, and pinned conversation layout |
| **File Uploads** | 1MB RPC payload limit fails on logs or datasets | Streams files asynchronously to disk via chunked streaming endpoint |
| **Touch Interaction** | 300ms tap delay and double-tap zoom | Sets `touch-action: manipulation` for immediate touch response |
| **Input Behavior** | Mobile Enter key sends message or corrupts CJK/Korean IME composition; line navigation jumps to text start when slash commands exist | Preserves native newline, prevents IME corruption, and restores visual line start navigation on Cmd+Left (macOS) / Home (all OS) with slash commands while preserving Ctrl+Left word navigation; Cmd/Ctrl+Enter submits |
| **Model Selection** | Tapping a model closes the menu immediately | Opens the reasoning effort submenu on tap |

Run `agy-server doctor` to inspect the status of all patches against your installed bundle.

## Security

- **Password Protection**: Passwords are hashed with PBKDF2-SHA256 (200,000 iterations).
- **Session Tokens**: 256-bit random tokens; only SHA-256 hashes are stored on disk.
- **Persistent CSRF Normalization**: Stored with restricted owner permissions (`0600`) and injected transparently through the proxy to prevent stale-session rejections.
- **Brute-Force Protection**: 5 failed login attempts trigger an IP lockout (5 to 30 minutes).
- **Upload Isolation**: File uploads are restricted to the configured project directory; path traversal attempts (`../`) are rejected.
- **Trusted Proxies**: Set `--trusted-proxies` when running behind Nginx, Caddy, or Cloudflare to prevent header spoofing.

## FAQ

**Google already has an official remote. Do I still need this?**  
Only if the official mobile web UI gets in your way, or you would rather not relay through Google's servers and would rather gate access with your own password. Both can run on the same machine; nothing here disables the official bridge.

**Does this require the Antigravity desktop GUI on Linux?**  
No. `agy-server` runs the core `language_server` binary headlessly.

**Will updates from Google break the patches?**  
Patches use adaptive regular expressions that match structural AST patterns rather than exact variable names. Run `agy-server update` to pull official upstream releases safely.

**Does my code pass through third-party servers?**  
No. Traffic flows directly between your client browser and your server instance. The only external connection is `language_server` communicating with Google's API.
